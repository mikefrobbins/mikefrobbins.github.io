As many of you know, I'm a Senior Content Developer for Azure PowerShell at Microsoft. Today we announced the <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell-migration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Az.Tools.Migration PowerShell module</a> which is a toolkit for automatically migrating your PowerShell scripts and modules from AzureRM to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-az-ps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Az PowerShell module</a>. The <a href="https://youtu.be/YxiPnAcOaxA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> shown below demonstrates how to use this module:

Be sure to see the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-tools/announcing-the-azurerm-to-az-powershell-module-migration-toolkit/ba-p/1724992" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official announcement</a> that I wrote on the Microsoft Tech Community blog site. In addition to the PowerShell module, there is also a <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=azps-tools.azps-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VS Code extension</a> for performing the migration.
